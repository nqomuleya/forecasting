# forecasting
#This project's aim was to forest the orginal data, then decompose it using Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Variational mode decomposition (VMD) 
#with either ARIMA or Neural Network to investigate the techniques that bear better forecating results. 
#A combination of decomposition methods and forecasting using either neural network or ARIMA improve our result significantly, 
#hence predicting commodtes prices using a combination of these techniques pays off.
#To check measurement of error the RMSE was used!!
